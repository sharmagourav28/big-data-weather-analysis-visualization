## 📊 Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to:

- To collect and process large volumes of historical weather data from over 4,000+ Indian cities using big data tools and frameworks.
- To perform comprehensive data cleaning, transformation, and time-series analysis to ensure high-quality input for modelling.
- To identify and analyse seasonal patterns, extreme weather events, and temperature trends to understand climate behaviour.
- To develop accurate predictive models for forecasting weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind speed.
- To build interactive and user-friendly visual dashboards for real-time monitoring of weather metrics including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation.
- To demonstrate the practical application of big data technologies in environmental monitoring and meteorological forecasting.
